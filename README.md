# Python-Keylogger
Python keylogger written for learning purposes. Utilizes the `ctypes`, `pyhook`, and `win32com` libraries. `GetForeGroundWindow` is used to get the current active window on the desktop. That is then passed to `GetWindowThreadProcessId` to retrieve the window’s PID. The process and the resulting process handle is used to find the executable name of the process. Then the full text of the window’s title bar using `GetWindowTextA` is retreived. PyHook is used to bind the `KeyDown` event to the callback function `KeyStroke`. PyHook is to hook all keypresses and continue execution. Whenever a key on the keyboard, the `KeyStroke` function is called.

This creates and logs to a file called `log.txt` in the directory of execution. A windowless compiled standalone executable is also included.
